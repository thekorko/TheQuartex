		<title>Blizzard announces Timewalking feature for World of Warcraft</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/7/4/9/2/6/2/blizzard-announces-timewalking-feature-for-world-of-warcraft-1429170534177.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1749262.jpg" alt=""/><p>Have you ever wanted to take in the sights and sounds of old Azeroth's dungeons at Level 100, but do so without pinging out-levelled bosses with a single hit? In a <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18710308/" target="_blank">post</a> on World of Warcraft's official website last night, Blizzard has revealed that you'll soon be able to do exactly that by using a new Timewalking feature.</p><p>It works like this. As part of a whole series of weekend events being planned for the game, you'll occasionally be able to participate in Timewalking weekends. During these special events, you'll be able to queue up for one of WOW's myriad old-school dungeons using the game's dungeon finder, and tackle the content with the team that's formed.</p><p>When you enter the dungeon, however, each character in the party will have their power and equipment scaled down drastically, ensuring that the dungeon presents a worthy challenge. Even more intriguing is Blizzard's plans for the loot - whatever weapons and armour you scoop from the bosses during the visit will be scaled <em>up</em> when you leave, ensuring you have a level 100-appropriate reward for your efforts.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-16-blizzard-announces-timewalking-feature-for-world-of-warcraft">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

These new player-driven goals exist to bring pilots together in pursuit of a common achievement: killing a certain number of enemy pilots in a particular system, for example, or providing a certain quantity of goods to a particular region. The success or failure of these multiplayer missions will have a tangible effect on the political stability of the region.</p><p>When the new patch goes live, pilots will be able to work together to build capital ships and starports to assist the exploration of deep space. All players will be able to contribute to these greater galactic causes, whether they choose to play in the game's Solo or Open modes.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-02-05-elite-dangerous-1-1-adds-community-goals-and-enhancements">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Desperately seeking Salty: A WOW fishing tale</title>

    <em>World of Warcraft turned ten on Sunday, and all throughout this week we'll be marking the anniversary with a series of features from across Eurogamer's editorial team. Having taken you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-24-learning-to-raid-in-praise-of-wows-finest-dungeon">through the game's finest dungeon</a>, today John tells the tale of how he bagged WOW's most elusive achievement.</em>
  </p><p>In a world packed with linear storylines, daily quests and gated dungeons, fishing has always been one of WOW's purest role-playing pursuits. Grab a metaphorical chair, listen to the siren song of the game's ethereal soundtrack, and embrace the gentle simplicity of a two button, click-to-cast minigame nestled within one of gaming's most marvellous worlds. When everything was new, and before all was efficiency and magic became mundane, this element of WOW was every bit as beguiling to me as even the grandest design strokes.</p><p>Although the profession became more tangibly useful in subsequent expansions, fishing remained something gloriously useless - almost defiantly so, given the increasing richness of more carefully crafted content sprinkled lavishly throughout Azeroth. From my first days exploring the Night Elf starting island, to my very last when fatigue set in and I just stopped logging in one day, it remained one of my favourite activities in the game.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-28-desperately-seeking-salty-a-wow-fishing-tale">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Learning to raid: in praise of WOW's finest dungeon</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/7/1/4/7/6/2/learning-to-raid-in-praise-of-wows-finest-dungeon-1413795984973.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1714762.jpg" alt=""/><p>
    <em>World of Warcraft turned ten on Sunday, and all throughout this week we'll be marking the anniversary with a series of features from across Eurogamer's editorial team. Today, John reminisces on the game's early raiding scene, and pays tribute to one of Blizzard's greatest dungeons.</em>
  </p><p>There were two paths ahead of you if you wanted to sample WOW's end-game raiding scene prior to the release of the game's first expansion. First, there were the cavernous zones such as Molten Core, designed for guilds large enough to field 40 players against the game's most monstrous creations. More accessible on paper - yet arguably less forgiving in practice - were the 20-player affairs like Zul'Gurub, the dense tropical jungle filled with poison and panic.</p><p>The Burning Crusade expansion shook things up by introducing an upper limit of 25 players for all raiding content. This transition towards tighter and more focused group combat was a double-edged sword, however. Raiding certainly became more accessible for players like me who existed outside of the largest guilds, but established raiding communities suffered a blunt mathematical division within their ranks.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-24-learning-to-raid-in-praise-of-wows-finest-dungeon">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

But the quality of the content does not excuse the subpar launch experience we delivered, and I apologize for that," the statement begins.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-18-wows-executive-producer-apologises-for-warlords-of-draenor-launch-problems">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>WildStar review</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/7/1/5/8/7/6/wildstar-review-1414145566210.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1715876.jpg" alt=""/><p>With Blizzard halting work on Titan and CCP putting a stake through eight years of World of Darkness development, the number of blockbuster MMORPGs visible on the horizon has slumped to an all-time low. Even the likes of just-released Destiny, which shares as much DNA with World of Warcraft as it does Halo, has been eager to avoid the toxicity of being associated with gaming's unwieldiest acronym. For a breed of multiplayer game that broke so explosively across our CRTs back in 1997 and seemed so utterly dominant just a few years ago, this feels like the end times.</p><p>How we got to this ignominious level cap for the genre-without-end is a discussion for another time, but if a lingering MMORPG apocalypse is indeed upon us, WildStar is well placed to offer a rousing send off. In direct contrast to Elder Scrolls Online's rather earnest and dour fugue, Carbine's WOW-baiting debut offers up an anthology of greatest hit MMO features, with just enough new material of its own to suggest that perhaps the persistent world party may have some life left in it after all.</p><p>The focus of WildStar's storyline is the planet Nexus, recently discovered by the game's good guys, the Exiles, who, as their name suggests, are in need of a new home. Meanwhile the big bad Dominion would rather have Nexus and its resources for themselves. Thus the game opens as the persistent battle between the two sides rages on, with the player, after having chosen their allegiance, taking on the role of saviour and/or vanquisher. It's the usual stuff, basically, where you have to pretend everyone else is playing a different scenario to you, which of course they're not.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-24-wildstar-review">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Five talking points from World of Warcraft's 6.0.2 patch</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/7/1/4/2/1/5/five-talking-points-from-world-of-warcrafts-6-0-2-patch-1413467956699.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1714215.jpg" alt=""/><p>Before every new WOW expansion there's a patch which lays the foundation for the next round of adventuring in Azeorth and beyond. This week's release of Patch 6.0.2 introduces extensive changes to the game's combat stats, plenty of interface tweaks across the board, and a new dungeon and quest-line to help players get accustomed to the Warlords of Draenor expansion before it arrives next month. Here's what jumped out at us as while we were poking around in the new content.</p><p>WOW's questing has come on leaps and bounds since 2004, but there's still an overwhelming dependence on point-to-point adventuring. While it serves a certain purpose nevertheless, there's nothing about the brief quest-line which introduces the next chapter of the game's grand story that suggests things will be radically different in Warlords of Draenor. The Iron Horde are storming through the Blasted Lands' Dark Portal to make their first tentative claims on Azeroth, and you're part of the vanguard monitoring the enemy's arrival.</p><p>The way the story unfolds from here is very firmly rooted in the core questing structure that was established in Mists of Pandaria - embark on a few exploratory sorties to pick off a specific type of target, interact with an object in some way, then do away with a trio of factional figureheads. It's very familiar ground, in other words, and if Warlords of Draenor evolves the questing concept further then it seems like a missed opportunity not to showcase it here.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-16-five-talking-points-from-world-of-warcrafts-6-0-2-patch">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

The new patch not only makes some fairly drastic changes to WOW's stats, characters and skillsets, there's also a new quest line and dungeon to keep you busy for the next few weeks.</p><p>Here's a quick look at all of the new quest and dungeon content in the new patch, and what you need to know to work your way through it.</p><p>There's nothing particularly revolutionary about the new quest-line that's popped up in the Blasted Lands - kill a certain kind of enemy, then kill three tougher-than-usual creatures, then go back and pick up your rewards. When you first log into the game after applying the patch, you'll be given the starting quest that takes you over to the Dark Portal region.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-15-world-of-warcraft-patch-6-0-2-guide">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

(The last time we checked our background downloader there was still another 8GB of data left to go, so if you've switched off automatic downloading in the past, you might want to think about re-enabling it ahead of launch.)</p><p>This time around, the traditional pre-expansion world event sees the legions of the Iron Horde invading Azeroth through the Dark Portal, and you'll be able to pop along when the patch goes live and bop a few of them on the chin.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-13-world-of-warcraft-patch-6-0-2-release-date-revealed">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>High profile departures at Eve Online maker CCP</title>

"Joe Gallo and David Reid did great work for CCP and I wish them well," he added in a statement translated in email by CCP. "Their contributions to CCP will be remembered, and we look forward to seeing what they do next."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-08-28-high-profile-departures-at-eve-online-maker-ccp">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Why is hardship the new hotness?</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/6/7/3/6/4/0/why-is-hardship-the-new-hotness-1398853375545.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1673640.jpg" alt=""/><p>I'm always late to the party - even when most of the people at the party are dead. In the case of DayZ, I'm very late indeed. It's been two years since Dean Hall's mod started to turn ordinary gamers into hardened survivalists, and in that time, it feels like the game has helped cement a genre - or something that certainly behaves like one. I get hundreds of press releases in my inbox every week, and about two thirds of them promise that the latest title I'm about to fall in love with is just like DayZ - or just like Minecraft. These titles are not unrelated. In 2014, we love foraging and scavenging. We love finding our own tools and getting by on next to nothing. We love hardship. We love suffering. It's no longer enough to just thrive - we want to feel the sharp edge of survival itself. </p><p>Why is this?</p><p>That's a question that's worth trying to answer, if only because these games feel so vital, and it would be nice to get some of that vitality into the rest of gaming, too. When I first dropped onto a DayZ server, for example, I just <em>waited</em>. I knew something awful was going to happen to me. I <em>wanted</em> something awful to happen to me. I wanted DayZ to kick me around, like it had kicked around all my friends. Sure enough, I didn't have to wait long.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-30-why-is-hardship-the-new-hotness">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Don't be surprised that just 2.2% of F2P players spend money</title>

		<title>Questing for heroism in MMOs</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/6/1/3/8/3/9/137847988877.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1613839.jpg" alt=""/><p>Dungeons and raids are usually the most exciting part of any MMO, but there's still depressingly little heroism to be had in most of them. To be fair, there's a tiny sliver of time when this isn't the case - when a new dungeon arrives in, say, World of Warcraft, and teams have to go face its bosses and other challenges without a convenient wiki on hand. Those early days can be amazing.</p><p>Almost immediately though, heroism goes from defying the odds to merely consulting them; of not simply going in to pit a party's skill against the latest threat to their world, but having the Dummies Guide To Killing This Guy under one arm. Worse, the expectation of this knowledge brings out the worst in the average MMO player, who has usually seen everything a hundred times and just wants to get to the end to get their shiny whatever.</p><p>Not only does this breed hostility towards new players, thanks to far too many old hands forgetting the time they served at the business end of the learning curve, it produces a vicious cycle where design increasingly has to be built around efficiency rather than actual adventure. The descent can be seen best in WOW, which started with dungeons of a comparable size and scope to a standard RPG, but inevitably got whittled down to little but a few boxes for bosses and corridors full of trash mobs. If anything, it's a wonder players still tolerate those.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-09-07-questing-for-heroism-in-mmos">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>EverQuest Next preview: a true next-gen MMO</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/6/0/3/7/3/9/137560419824.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1603739.jpg" alt=""/><p>It's impossible to resist introducing you to the official unveiling of a post-World of Warcraft MMO without referencing the Las Vegas environment SOE has chosen for showcasing EverQuest Next. Broken dreams, disappointments, big stakes and heavy losses abound in both of these entertainment industries, after all. Admittedly there <em>are</em> fewer prostitutes, binge-drinking chugalugs and Dolly Parton-themed slot machines in your average fantasy MMO, but it's certainly a metaphor with legs.</p><p>SOE is at least going all in with this new EverQuest adventure, and it's a game that largely abandons a template still capable of drawing a convention's worth of fans together. It's a bold vision of what the company thinks a next-generation MMO should look like, and it begins with the world itself. Constructed using voxel technology - and layered on top of a heavily modified version of the engine powering PlanetSide 2 - the destruction and manipulation of your next home from home lies at the heart of almost every design decision.</p><p>At the personal level of combat, spellcasts and melee manoeuvres - dished out so repetitively as part of the MMO combat canon - have a tangible effect on this particular world. In a demo set in a dark forest ruins, blade flurries tear apart the crumbling walls, while spells shatter the floor and send enemies tumbling into the depths below. It's in those depths that you'll find another of EverQuest Next's bolder design approaches - underground levels layered one beneath the other, where procedurally generated ruins, questing opportunities and riches lie waiting to be explored and recovered.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-08-02-everquest-next-preview">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Jagex hopes to have RuneScape on tablets by the end of the year</title>

		<title>Eve Online: Into the second decade</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/5/7/8/2/8/6/136800695408.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1578286.jpg" alt=""/><p>
Ten years after its launch, Eve Online is in a strange place. It's a game with just 500,000 players, nothing by most MMO standards, yet one whose stories, heists and controversies regularly spark interest in a wider audience that would never actually dream of playing it. On Twitter, I asked my followers what would make them give it a shot at this point. "Nothing," was the standard answer. "A complete reset," answered a couple more. Perhaps most notably, "Any change that would make me want to play would stop it from being Eve."</p><p>This is not of course lost on CCP. "For a long time we've been thinking how to engage the large group of people who are fascinated by this universe, the promise of what Eve can be, but this particular game is too hard, too cut-throat, too complicated, too hardcore," former senior producer Jon Lander told me. Later, chief marketing officer David Reid was happy to admit "Eve is a hard game, and we're okay with that. Some of those people will never be Eve players, and probably never should. But it shouldn't necessarily be as hard to understand it. The gamers who made this company over the first decade are going to look a little different in the second, coming from free-to-play, mobile and tablet. A big part of our job is bringing them into the universe."</p><p>The key words there are 'particular game' and 'universe', especially at this year's Eve FanFest, where shooter Dust 514 and CCP's line "Eve Is Real" together got at least as much attention as the spaceships. I'll admit to having been a bit skeptical of Dust actually playing a big role in the main universe, but this year's announcements made it clear that it's far from just a throw-away game. Whether they work out or not in the long-term, and 'long-term' is the timeline, CCP has huge plans in mind for it. First we have the Uprising (free) expansion where Dust players can break away from the server-browser high-security planets to start actually conquering worlds. </p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-08-eve-online-into-the-second-decade">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>A postcard from Reykjavik: Inside 2013's Eve FanFest</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/5/7/6/5/6/8/136740473051.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1576568.jpg" alt=""/><p>To understand Eve Online, you need to visit Reykjavik. It won't help with mundane details like which battlecruiser to aspire to, but the ride from Keflavik airport to both CCP and FanFest's home town is an eye-opening experience. Simply knowing that Iceland has a hostile interior is nothing compared to actually seeing it - not merely how small its patches of civilisation are amongst seemingly infinite emptiness with no trees and often nothing to see but the remnants of volcanic activity covered in moss, but the kind of community it takes to handle it.</p><p>Even with a Subway seemingly on every corner, this remains a tough land for tough people, clustered together and very aware of the need for co-operation. We're talking a culture so interconnected that there's a genuine not-a-joke smartphone app to help Icelanders make sure they don't accidentally get jiggy with <em>too close</em> a relative. Just driving through is to realise that Iceland may not be the only place Eve Online could have been made, but it's as much a part of its soul as the spaceships, with Reykjavik its own high-sec region. They even share a currency, making for at least one bizarre moment when we're told the event has raised two million ISK for charity. Actual money, or spacebucks? Do charities need battlecruisers?</p><p>FanFest's location, the Harpa, is a giant concert hall built of slanted, multicoloured crystal that I wouldn't be shocked to one day hear had taken off to finally rejoin the mothership. Inside is equally cool, a convention location that M.C. Escher might have designed, with staircases spiking up and down and drawing the eye into unusual places. Adding to the endearing chaos, CCP has renamed all of the rooms with Eve names like "Tranquility" and "Multiplicity", but the signs everywhere still point to the likes of "Eldborg" and "Silfurberg" and "Toilets", and all of them seem to have at least one entrance somewhere just to confuse.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-01-inside-2013s-eve-fanfest">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Visit Eve Online in Oculus Rift</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/5/7/5/5/2/6/136698973612.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1575526.jpg" alt=""/><p>What do you get if you combine Eve Online with the Oculus Rift? A loud enough whoop to knock the roof off this year's FanFest in Reykjavik, followed by the kind of queues God himself has never seen to have a go. I'm actually writing this in advance of the announcement, but I'm quietly confident. One of the most beautiful space games ever. Virtual reality. 1500 people who travelled to Iceland to celebrate Eve Online. There will be whooping.</p><p>Luckily, I had a chance to play it earlier on, and can confirm that it's worth it. Should the opportunity to play it present itself, snap it up. If you're at FanFest and thinking you'll skip the queue for some reason, go stand in it right now. Really. Impossibly long or not, you will bitterly regret if it you don't, possibly to the extent of enlisting the girl at the tattoo booth downstairs to ink on a permanent mark of shame. But why make two mistakes at one event?</p><p>To be clear though, this isn't actually Eve Online VR, but a Unity powered, 3x3 dogfighting game using some of its assets and put together by CCP employees as a side-project. It's called EVR. It's not a finished game. The official CCP line is that no decisions have been made about its future - whether it gets the resources to become an actual Oculus Rift game/Eve spin-off, is just brought out this time next year as a FanFest tradition, or is never played again.
 
A game only lasts three minutes, most of it spent staring and going "Oooh..." and trying not to make any unfortunate faces for unseen people to cruelly shoot with their camera-phones. This was my first time with an Oculus Rift, and while the experience was naturally a bit blurry and unkind to my glasses-wearing, astigmatic eyes, it was still hugely impressive. </p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-26-visit-eve-online-in-oculus-rift">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Questing for freedom in The Elder Scrolls Online</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2013/articles/1/5/6/4/7/8/2/136361224639.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1564782.jpg" alt=""/><p>The words 'theme park MMO' get thrown around a lot these days, but rarely have they felt more apt than during my four hours with The Elder Scrolls Online. If Skyrim, Cyrodiil and so on are worlds, TESO smacks of the World Showcase from Disney's Epcot - familiar sights remade in fibreglass to be admired but never seriously mistaken for the original. Not as many gift shops. Far more spiders. This time, the park owners will actively block your path until you agree to sit through the local equivalent of "O Canada". Still, the comparison fits.</p><p>I'd love to be wrong about this, and a few hours clearly isn't anything like enough time to get the measure of a whole MMORPG. It, however, is plenty of time to be disappointed by its direction. It's not that TESO isn't polished, professional or well crafted - in most of the details, it's as strong and accomplished and well-crafted as anything else out there. From the sections I got to play and the higher-end content demoed though, it feels like an MMO given an Elder Scrolls makeover, not The Elder Scrolls reinvented as an MMO.</p><p>Expecting Skyrim-style world simulation, freedom, depth and player agency is unrealistic in a game that has to handle thousands of players messing around, and unless things change radically as the story progresses, TESO doesn't try for that. Its world has an empty vibe to it, with very little interaction density and quest-givers just sitting around holding out for a hero. For the Daggerfall Covenant faction's starting area, the island of Stros M'Kai, that means helping a group of pirates rescue kidnapped colleagues and stealing goodies that inevitably don't mean much booty despite you doing all the hard work.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-03-19-questing-for-freedom-in-the-elder-scrolls-online">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>The final hours of City of Heroes</title>

There's the occasional alien invasion, just for old time's sake. In hidden laboratories, mad scientists who haven't heard the news that City of Heroes is to be shut down at midnight continue their plans to conquer a doomed world. Civilians find themselves alone in empty streets. "Where's a hero when you need them?" they sigh.</p><p>Tonight, they're mostly in Atlas Park, Paragon City's central hub. They've fought demons and psychic clockwork monsters and evil cultists and gods and ghosts and vampires, but they can't fight destiny. As I log in to join the final hours of the best superhero MMO ever made, they stand united with flaming torches and the occasional generic protest sign from the emote bank, collectively staring into the eye of destruction and daring it to blink.</p><p>Well, that's the idea. Unfortunately, due to the positioning of a giant statue of modern hero Atlas bent over in front of City Hall by the weight of the world on his shoulders, in practice everyone here is spending their last few hours staring deep into a giant stone anus.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-04-the-final-hours-of-city-of-heroes">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

		<title>Waiting for the end of the world: City of Heroes retrospective</title>

City of Heroes wasn't even close to the first MMORPG I ever played, but it was the first that understood that even Level 1 can feel awesome. It didn't simply let you play as a superhero. It let you feel like a superhero, hurling fire, swinging swords, controlling the minds of lesser men and more. Best of all, with a character creation system no MMORPG has ever beaten, it was <em>your</em> superhero. Other people might have the same powers. None would be quite like you.</p><p>Unless you'd just copied Batman, obviously. Then all bets were off.</p><p>Sadly, all things come to an end. This Friday, night falls on the City of Heroes for the last time. The servers are being switched off. Never again will Frostfire glance out of his base and shake his head at the sight of heroes skiing around on his ice-ramps instead of coming to fight him. No more will Perez Park confuse the hell out of newcomers, or anything secretly turn out to be a Nemesis plot.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-29-waiting-for-the-end-of-the-world-city-of-heroes-retrospective">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

Did ArenaNet contradict itself?</p><p>"I hope we've been clear that GW2 is not a game with virtually no stat progression in it like GW1 was," ArenaNet co-founder and boss <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/13tuac/im_the_studio_design_director_on_guild_wars_2_ama/" target="_blank">Mike O'Brien wrote on Reddit</a>.

		<title>Saturday Soapbox: Death of the MMORPG</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2012/articles/135307877958.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1528795.jpg" alt=""/><p>
MMORPGs had a good run. There's no shame in admitting their time in the sun is over, and that it's time to package the whole genre into a small cardboard box, label it 'Fond Memories', and slide it under the bed with classic adventures and those little dancing flower things that seemed like magic back in the '80s. </p><p>Obviously, yes, plenty of MMORPGs are doing just fine right now. World of Warcraft boasts over 10 million players, and at least a few of them aren't just there because they can't be bothered to cancel. Guild Wars 2, Eve Online and several of the games that have just turned F2P are doing fine, and would be crazy to shut themselves down just to help me make my point. It would be nice though, if any of them are listening. Blizzard? Hello?</p><p>That's not the issue though. People still make adventure games, and do well from them. That doesn't mean it's still a top-tier genre, and largely for the same reason - people still play them, but the numbers failed to scale along with the industry. Once upon a time, MMORPG numbers were the gold standard for online user-bases, when a million was an impossible number that AAA games dreamed of hitting over time.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-17-saturday-soapbox-death-of-the-mmorpg">Read more</a></p>]]></description>

</p><p>
Only, well, I wish he'd done some preparation. Instead, in he wafted with no bloody idea what was going on. The real patients (test subjects, even) were to be Tom Bramwell and me, Robert Purchese, his guests.
</p><p>
But it was calamity averted when Champion looked for a champion among you, our listener(s). In a moment of delirious ingenuity he gathered your questions, thousands of them (well, a couple of dozen), cobbled them together and fired them pow-pow-pow at our faces.

Guild Wars 2 won't have a monthly subscription fee but will have micro-transactions, and developer ArenaNet has shared more information on how that will work.
</p><p>
Guild Wars 1 had micro-transactions as an "afterthought", <a href="http://www.arena.net/blog/mike-obrien-on-microtransactions-in-guild-wars-2 ">wrote ArenaNet co-founder Mike O'Brien 2</a> - Guild Wars 2 has them at its foundations.
</p><p>
"We believe in micro-transactions because they fund ongoing development of the game in a very straightforward and open way," O'Brien added.

		<title>Subscription MMOs aren't dying, says LOTRO maker Turbine</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2012/articles//a/1/4/4/1/5/7/0/450-0ybcvq.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1441570.jpg" alt=""/><p>
It's not subscription MMOs that are dying, Lord of the Rings Online and Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online maker Turbine told Eurogamer - it's antiquated games that insist upon a single method of payment.
</p><p>
"People now in the West expect to have full control over their entertainment dollar and spend it the way they want to," explained Adam Mersky, Warner's (Turbine's owner) digital communications Witch King.
</p><p>
"It's probably not right to say the subscription MMO is dying, it's probably more right to say the idea of forcing a player to only have one option for having to consume your content - that's probably dying."

BioWare has promised to discuss European Star Wars: The Old Republic maintenance windows after the service was inaccessible on Saturday from 8am to 12pm GMT.
</p><p>
That four-hour update  - patch 1.1.0c - did one thing: "Improved service to reduce the number of player disconnections to the character selection screen."
</p><p>
BioWare explained that the change was "urgently required".

		<title>Eurogamer.net Podcast #94: That was the news 2011!</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2011/articles//a/1/4/3/2/4/2/1/KazHirai.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1432421.jpg" alt=""/><p>
Yes! Welcome to episode 94 of the Eurogamer.net Podcast! As the year grinds to a halt, it's time to reflect on the games that have made suffering the internet bearable. But it's not all about working out which game is better than that other game and putting it into a list. Sometimes, it's about the NEWS.
</p><p>
One of those sometimes is this time, so we've prepared a very special end of year special podcast that is all sorts of special, and also a quiz. Senior staff writer Robert "Bertie" Purchese asks the questions, does funny impressions and has no idea what the score is. Eurogamer news editor Wesley "bulls**t" Yin-Poole, US news editor Fred Dutton (who just got off the plane from Baltimore) and website and video administrator and writer wizard Tom "I don't need HD graphics or Achievements to enjoy Zelda" Phillips answer the questions, recounting the biggest stories from one of the most tumultuous years in video gaming history.
</p><p>
Who can forget the PSN hack? Or Geohot jailbreaking the PS3? Or the Nintendo 3DS price cut? Or the Xbox Live hack-oh no wait that was phishing and there is definitely NO EVIDENCE OF A HACK!? We can't. That's why we're on the quiz.

		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2011/articles//a/1/4/2/9/8/7/2/450-sqb3y6.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1429872.jpg" alt=""/><p>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Voting is now closed for this year's Eurogamer Readers' Top 50 Games! You can still use the form below but your input will no longer count towards the totals. It's a bit like watching X Factor on a Wednesday, if you like. Look out for the final Top 50 list to do up on 1st January 2012!
</p><p>
<strong>ORIGINAL POST:</strong> It's almost the end of the year and it is <em>high time</em> we found out what you think are the best games of the past 12 months. As is tradition, we are asking you to name your top five games and give us a bit of commentary on why they meant so much to you. We'll then take that information and combine it to create a representative list of the Eurogamer readership's Top 50 Games of 2011, which we'll publish on 1st January 2012 along with a selection of your comments.
</p><p>
There are no wrong answers and no prizes (if you must have prizes, have a crack on our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-12-02-massive-12-days-of-christmas-xbox-giveaway-survey">12 Days of Christmas Xbox Giveaway</a>), and if you feel there are games missing from the voting forms then please <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/contact.php">get in touch by email</a> or <a>Twitter</a> and if they should be on there (i.e. they were released during 2011) we will amend for you.

		<title>Three more Game of Thrones tie-ins announced</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>
Three more games based on George R R Martin's fantasy saga Game of Thrones are in the works, following recent PC strategy effort, Game of Thrones: Genesis.
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/story/2011-11-07/game-of-thrones/51116740/1">USA Today</a>, a full RPG is in development at Cyanide - the same studio behind Genesis - for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, with Atlus set to publish.

An MMO based on Sony Pictures' forthcoming remake of 1990 sci-fi classic Total Recall is on its way to browsers.
</p><p>
Currently in the works at Chinese studio ZQGame with SEE Games on publisher duties, it'll be a free-to-play title boasting a hybrid of features from traditional MMOs and social games, such as PVP and PVE play and a collaborative "memory quest" system. 
</p><p>
It's being built on a specially designed engine that's apparently capable of managing a large scale 3D MMO within a browser platform.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>
The number of people playing DC Universe Online simultaneously has risen over 1000 per cent since the superhero MMO turned free to play, Sony Online Entertainment has revealed.
</p><p>
"We are over 1000 per cent of our pre-F2P concurrent numbers," tweeted SOE president <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/j_smedley/status/133270049996800001" target="_blank">John Smedley</a>.

		<title>Lego Universe to close in January</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>
The Lego Universe MMO shuts up shop on 31st January 2012, The Lego Group has announced
</p><p>
The company explained that despite "a large number of players in the free play zone" it had not converted a satisfactory number of users into paying subscribers.
</p><p>
As a result of the game's closure, Colorado-base developer Play Well Studios is also being shut down along with a marketing team in Denmark, resulting in the loss of 115 jobs. Lego is promising to help those affected find new employment.

		<title>Layoffs threaten Star Trek - Infinite Space</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<p>
Star Trek - Infinite Space may never get the chance to boldly go where no other free to play browser based MMO has gone before after creator Gameforge axed 100 staff.
</p><p>
The German publisher made the cuts as part of a company-wide restructure that saw the cancellation of HellBreed and Mythos.
</p><p>
Now Star Trek - Infinite Space, its biggest game, is under threat, and plans for a beta - previously pegged for release "soon" - have been halted.

		<title>Free-to-play DC Universe picks up 120,000 new users</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2011/articles//a/1/4/1/7/8/4/6/dc_scr_grpAct_CoastCity_006_SDCC.jpg.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1417846.jpg" alt=""/><p>
Superhero MMO DC Universe Online has picked up 120,000 new users since going free-to-play on Monday, according to Sony Online Entertainment boss John Smedley.
</p><p>
According to a post on Smedley's <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/j_smedley/status/132145168299196417" target="_blank">Twitter feed</a>, concurrent users are up 400 per cent.
</p><p>
Of course, the trick will be keeping hold of all those new players, a cause that might not be helped by <a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/11/03/dc-universe-online-sees-120000-new-pc-players-less-than-48-hours-after-going-free-to-play/" target="_blank">reports</a> of server stability issues and long queues to log-in to the game.

		<title>Bethesda loses Fallout MMO appeal</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2011/articles//a/1/4/1/5/5/7/7/robot.jpg.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1415577.jpg" alt=""/><p>
Work can continue on Interplay's planned Fallout MMO after Bethesda lost an appeal upholding a court's decision to deny it a preliminary injunction against the developer.
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2011/06/29/interplay-says-bethesda-knew-fallout-mmo-would-in-fact-be-a-fa/" target="_blank">Joystiq</a>, Bethesda failed to convince the judge that the district court had "abused its discretion and misapplied the law" earlier this year when it ruled that Bethesda had failed to show Interplay's game could cause "irreparable harm."
</p><p>
Had Bethesda's claim been successful, the Fallout MMO would not have been able to use the franchise's story, characters or other identifiable elements.

		<title>Blizzard: F2P not the best model for WOW</title>
		<description><![CDATA[<img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2011/articles//a/1/4/1/5/0/0/0/wowexpansion_3.jpg.jpg/EG11/resize/300x-1/format/jpg/1415000.jpg" alt=""/><p>
A free-to-play business model isn't right for gargantuan MMO World of Warcraft right now, Blizzard has said.
</p><p>
So confident is Blizzard in the value offered by the £9-a-month subscription fee that boss Mike Morhaime has described it as "unmatched".
</p><p>
Games that have switched to free-to-play recently include Age of Conan, Star Trek Online, Lord of the Rings Online and DC Universe Online.
