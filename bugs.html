Bug #1 - Lingotek category translation doesn't work
I enabled lingotek logs
Because it is not downloading category translations
So the bug is that it's not downloading category translations when i press the button
it could be a server side problem or a plugin or php problem
Posts translation works fine, and lingotek connection is fine too.
